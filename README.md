# IR Showdown for DIY Gamer Kit

This is a multiplayer game for the [DIY Gamer Kit](http://www.techwillsaveus.com/shop/diy-kits/diy-gamer-kit-arduino/).

Both players press start. A countdown starts taking place, saying **ready**, **set**, **go**! Once go is written to the screen, users can press start to fire. Last person who fires loses. A message is displayed to both the winner and loser's screen. 

## Installation

Add the cloned folder inside your Arduino sketchbook. The location of this folder will depend on your operating system:

	Operating System|Folder
	----------------|----------------------------------
	Windows         |`My Documents\Arduino\libraries`
	Mac OS X        |`Documents/Arduino/libraries`
	Linux           |`~/Documents/Arduino/libraries`

The exact folder on your computer may be a little different. That's OK.

## To-do

We are still pretty early on in its development, but the skeleton is there. Add to-do items here.
